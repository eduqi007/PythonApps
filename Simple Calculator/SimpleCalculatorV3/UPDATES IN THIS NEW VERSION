The problems to be solved:

                                                                              LOGIC PROBLEMS
1. How I am alterning the multiplication and division using a exponencial, some times if u have 0 and makes 0^(-1) u will get an math error, so I am going to fix it soon. (FIXED) - NOW I JUST NEED TO PUT A WARNING IN CASE OF THE USER TRYING TO DIVIDE BY 0 
2. The ans function is working, but I made it in a strange way, if u just wanna use de ANS value it will erase the past values so u cant use de ans in the middle of an account, i will change this issue too. (FIXED)

                                                                         WHATS THE NEWS OF THIS NEW VERSION 3.0?
(CHANGES IN THE CODE)I refactored the past codes using python POO, and I tried to get this code the most clean and organized as possible separating the UI of the logic of the states of the operation. 

(NEW FUNCTIONS) But in overral we dont have any new functionality in the app, it just changed the design of the code.
